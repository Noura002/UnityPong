# UnityPong
Pong is a classic arcade video game inspired by table tennis, featuring basic two-dimensional graphics. Developed by Atari and launched in 1972, it was among the first arcade games ever created. Allan Alcorn designed Pong as part of a training project given to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. The idea for the game was influenced by an electronic ping-pong game found in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first-ever home gaming console.
